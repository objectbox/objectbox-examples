# ObjectBox Maven project example (experimental)

This example shows how to use ObjectBox in a plain-Java project built by Maven.

Note that Maven support is a work in progress; let us know if you have feedback for us.

This example is separate from the other examples, import the pom.xml file as a new Maven project. 

To build and execute the program, run with Maven like this: `./mvnw compile exec:java`.
